Sure! Here's a general approach you can take to optimize your learning while solving data structure questions on LeetCode:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand what it's asking for. Identify the input, output, constraints, and any edge cases.

2. **Review Data Structure Basics**: Ensure you have a solid understanding of the data structure(s) involved in the problem. For example, if it's a problem involving arrays, make sure you understand array manipulation, searching, sorting, etc.

3. **Visualize Examples**: Take a few simple examples and manually work through them to understand how the solution should behave. This will help you grasp the problem better.

4. **Identify Time and Space Complexity**: Before jumping into coding, try to analyze the time and space complexity of your solution. This will help you understand if your solution is optimal or if there's room for improvement.

5. **Brainstorm Solutions**: Think about different approaches to solve the problem. Start with the brute force approach, and then try to optimize it. Common strategies include using two pointers, dynamic programming, recursion with memoization, etc.

6. **Write Pseudocode**: Once you have a plan, write pseudocode outlining the steps you'll take to solve the problem. This will help you organize your thoughts before writing actual code.

7. **Code and Test Incrementally**: Write your code incrementally, testing each part as you go along. This will help you catch any bugs early and ensure your solution is on the right track.

8. **Test Extensively**: After you've written your solution, test it with different test cases, including edge cases and large inputs. Make sure it produces the correct output for all scenarios.

9. **Optimize**: If your solution works but is not optimal, think about ways to optimize it further. This might involve tweaking your algorithm or data structure choice.

10. **Review Solutions**: After solving the problem, review other people's solutions. Try to understand different approaches and learn from them. Look for elegant solutions with better time and space complexity.

11. **Reflect and Iterate**: Reflect on what you've learned from solving the problem and incorporate it into your future practice. Iterate on the problem-solving process to improve your skills over time.

By following these steps and practicing regularly, you'll not only improve your problem-solving skills but also gain a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms.
